Clone this repository as well as the [server app](https://github.com/wmyers/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) for this example.

First, run the CORS enabled server app in port 3001. It only accepts client requests from http://localhost:8080

Then, run `npm install` on this project and `npm start` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See the blog post [here](http://wmyers.github.io/technical/react-flux/Authentication-routing-in-a-React-Flux-application/) for further info.
